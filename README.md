# A miniature Javascript animation framework.
Animation framework. Will replace the source code example runner in the 
[it001](https://github.com/ustegrew/ustegrew.github.io) course. The 
present source code example runner is very cumbersome to integrate
into the site which makes maintenance difficult.

## Reverse plug...
I don't have intentions to develop this project into a fully blown animation engine. It's 
primarily for personal learning, and it's meant to provide simple animations which I can 
use in the it001 course. 

If you are looking for an animation/gaming framework that you can use now then 
there are already many frameworks out there. For an overview, see
[here](https://html5gameengine.com) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_engines).
 
Games engines I've tried in the past / would like to try in the future:
*   [Godot engine](http://godotengine.org)
*   [crafty js](http://craftyjs.com)
